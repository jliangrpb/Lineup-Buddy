Background

Welcome to Lineup-Buddy! For those who are unfamiliar, the game Valorant is a very popular online competitive First Person Shooter (FPS) game. The most played modes in the game are unrated/competitive where two teams of 5 players face off in order to be the first to reach 13 rounds. Each round being played out consists of an Attacking Team as well as a Defending team. The way you win a round is either by eliminating all opposing players OR for the Attacking Team, plant the spike and defend the spike until the timer runs out, if you are on the Defending Team, either prevent the Attacking team from planting the spike within an alloted time or to defuse the planted spike by the Attacking Team. As an Attacker, the time after the spike is planted (post-plant) is usually the most stressful as you definitely want to keep the Defenders from defusing the spike without exposing yourself to danger. Some Characters (agents) have tools that aid them in doing so (utility), and within the community, there are safe locations within the map to shoot said utility to prevent losing the round. The caveat is that, there are way too many lineups for a singular person to remmber, often times I also find myself forgeting which lineup goes where, leading to a lost round.

Worry no more! This project serves as a tool via data visualization tool to show the user(you!) where to position yourself and where to aim your crosshair or hud in order to successfully execute the lineup without having to spend hours committing the lineup to memory (I am very guilty of this). The user should be able to select a Map (Most likely the one you are playing on) and then select an agent from a preset list, the map would then show buttons on the map (which would be the player's agent) where clicking on the button shows the user two images: 1 being an img of the position, 2 the lineup spot. Now get in there and win some rounds. We are Valorant WE are FIGHTERS!
